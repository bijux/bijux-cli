- Added `bijux_cli_py.dag_sdk` with Python helpers for loading DAG graph JSON,
  delegating validation/planning/execution to `bijux-dag`, inspecting runs, and
  querying artifact registries while preserving the CLI JSON payload contract.

<!-- towncrier start -->

## 0.4.0 – 2026-07-04

### Added
- Added `bijux_cli_py.app_sdk` with mounted-app manifest builders, compatibility-window helpers, JSON success/failure envelopes, and a callable runner that preserves clean stdout contracts.

### Changed
- Advanced the Python distribution to the `v0.4.0` release line alongside the public DAG Rust crate family.
- Relaxed facade fallback behavior so packaging and helper tests can keep working when the native bridge is unavailable but explicit Python fallback is allowed.
- Documented the mounted-app packaging flow and shared it with the Rust root runtime contract.

<a id="v0-3-6"></a>

## 0.3.6 – 2026-04-21

### Changed
- Aligned `bijux-cli-python` documentation badges with the shared repository contract so crate docs surfaces stay in sync with root and handbook badge ordering.
- Updated badge rendering to keep repository/package badge semantics stable after the rust-docs label-style transition in the shared badge generator.
- Refreshed packaging test expectations around Python extras and dependency policy so contract tests continue to validate the current package metadata shape.

### Fixed
- Removed managed badge drift in `crates/bijux-cli-python/README.md` and generated docs pages by regenerating package badge blocks from the shared automation source.
- Raised the pytest floor in package contracts to address the pip-audit advisory path affecting packaging validation runs.

<a id="v0-3-5"></a>

## 0.3.5 – 2026-04-12

### Changed
- Grouped shared release-channel badges onto one line and shared documentation badges onto one line across repository and package surfaces.
- Advanced the repository release metadata and compatibility defaults to the `v0.3.5` line.

### Fixed
- Removed badge ordering drift between the root README, package READMEs, and docs landing pages by regenerating all managed badge blocks from the shared catalog.

<a id="v0-3-4"></a>

## 0.3.4 – 2026-04-06

### Changed
- Updated release metadata and automation to align with the unified `bijux-core` repository model.
- Corrected release-tree stamping and DAG workflow package references to use `bijux-dev` consistently.
- Aligned DAG CI toolchains and paths with the current workspace structure.

### Fixed
- Prevented accidental crates.io publication of `bijux-dag-*` crates by marking them internal-only.
- Corrected root documentation links and release guidance to match the current docs tree and repository boundaries.
- Added explicit release policy documentation: publish `bijux-cli` at `v0.3.4`; defer DAG publication to `v0.4.0`.

<a id="v0-3-0"></a>

## 0.3.0 – 2026-03-14

### Added
- Rust-owned runtime crates for the end-user binary (`bijux`), the Python bridge package, and the workspace-only maintainer control plane (`bijux-dev-cli`)
- Typed command routing, execution-kernel contracts, structured output schemas, and parity coverage across the binary, core runtime, Python bridge, and routed REPL surface
- Runtime support for config, history, memory, install, version, completion, and state-doctor behavior that is backed by focused parity, corruption, and resilience coverage
- Shipped plugin lifecycle management with routed execution, install/inspect/check/explain/enable/disable/uninstall flows, reserved-namespace enforcement, and Cookiecutter-backed Python and Cargo templates
- Interactive REPL execution with shared CLI semantics, history compatibility, completion, diagnostics, and hostile-session resilience coverage
- Installation diagnostics, first-run state setup, explicit shell completion output, official-product install alias resolution, and stable state-path reporting
- Python packaging through the crate-owned `bijux-cli-python` surface with maturin/pyo3 bindings, native facade fallbacks, and bridge-vs-runtime parity checks
- Opt-in structured telemetry and bounded trace diagnostics for runtime and maintainer execution paths
- Maintainer command contracts and evidence reports for runtime identity, route audits, parity, repository health, docs audits, and publish-time contract assets

### Changed
- Migrated the repository from the older Python-first layout to a Rust-first workspace with `crates/`, `configs/`, `contracts/`, `makes/`, and canonical docs sections
- Reduced the public root runtime surface to shipped commands, moved maintainer automation behind `bijux-dev-cli`, and kept the `cli` namespace as the canonical compatibility surface
- Standardized runtime identity so checkout builds derive from the latest real git tag line while release workflows stamp exact tagged versions into release artifacts
- Reworked plugin compatibility handling, manifest contracts, scaffold defaults, and template guidance around the current plugin runtime and pre-1.0 host boundaries
- Consolidated release engineering around stamped release trees, pinned workflow/toolchain inputs, stable package metadata, and explicit publish gates for crates.io and PyPI artifacts
- Rebuilt the public docs canon, changelog policy, contributor guidance, and security policy around current runtime behavior instead of historical Python-era assumptions
- Moved maintainer evidence generation from legacy scripts into `bijux-dev-cli` report/query surfaces and contract-driven documentation publishing

### Removed
- Legacy `bijux-cli` compatibility executable naming; `bijux` is now the only runtime command name
- Legacy runtime ownership of maintainer/dev namespaces from the end-user command surface
- Legacy automation script paths, root git-hook wiring, root OpenAPI/Node release remnants, and the previous MkDocs builder pipeline
- Legacy duplicate Python distribution/test roots outside `crates/bijux-cli-python`
- Legacy docs trees, stale policy fragments, and compatibility shims that no longer matched the canonical runtime/docs layout
- Demo-grade root commands, placeholder plugin execution paths, and stale maintainer fallback behavior that no longer matched the shipped runtime contract

### Fixed
- Corrected plugin routing so installed plugins and aliases execute through the runtime instead of stopping at placeholder errors
- Hardened `doctor`, `status`, install diagnostics, state-path handling, and registry/history/memory recovery so health output reflects actual runtime conditions
- Corrected config precedence, config mutation flows, help/usage handling, completion shell selection, and root/`cli` route normalization to match the current runtime law
- Aligned Rust, Python, and release metadata around supported hosts, package ownership, explicit completion shells, and tag-derived version provenance
- Tightened plugin manifest validation, runtime floors, registry locking, and scaffold build behavior for Python and Rust plugin projects
- Strengthened REPL hostile-session behavior, history bounds, multiline parsing, completion registries, and shared CLI/REPL execution parity
- Bounded runtime and maintainer telemetry fields, trace payloads, and observability lifecycle reporting so diagnostics stay structured under failure and scale
- Reduced Python bootstrap noise in common Make workflows and cleared remaining release-line/documentation drift around the shipped runtime boundary

<a id="v0-2-0"></a>

## 0.2.0 – 2026-01-26

### Added
- Linear bootstrap flow with explicit bootstrap boundaries and a first-class `CLIIntent`
- Rebuilt E2E suite with domain taxonomy, invariants, and a subprocess harness
- Nightly fuzz and stress suites under `tests/nightly` with dedicated markers
- Expanded regression coverage for bootstrap paths, flags matrix, plugin loader/metadata, and real serializer roundtrips
- Benchmarks with thresholds for startup, discovery (cold/warm), config load, REPL, and help/version fast paths
- API contract gating with stricter schema validation and schemathesis checks
- Docs rebuilt into concepts/guides/reference/examples with section indexes
- API purity guard enabled in CI to prevent IO in API calls

### Changed
- Centralized CLI policy resolution for routing, exit intent, and precedence
- Infra strictness: explicit formats/targets required; no guessing
- Plugin lifecycle contract with explicit states and early metadata validation
- Test organization aligned to `src/` with merged regression suite and nightly rename
- MkDocs generator and nav rebuilt to match the new docs tree

### Fixed
- Help output routing for structured formats
- Exit-policy invariants to detect real Python tracebacks only
- API validation error payloads now JSON-encoded with stable schema

### Removed
- Legacy root docs pages and ADR directory (decisions moved into canonical docs)
- Thin CLI core wrappers (emit/validation) consolidated

## 0.1.3 – 2025-08-20

### Added
* **ADR-0005:** Zero-root-pollution via **Makefile-orchestrated artifact containment** (all generated outputs under `artifacts/`).  
* **Curated release assets:** zipped bundles for **tests (py311/py312/py313)** and for **lint, quality, security, api, docs, sbom, citation, build**, plus consolidated **checksums**.
* **End-to-end automation:** GitHub Actions to **publish to PyPI**, **create a GitHub Release** with curated bundles, and **deploy docs**.

### Changed
* **Makefiles + workflows** brought into **full ADR-0005 compliance**: CI uploads/downloads only `artifacts/**`; docs deploy hydrates from CI artifacts and builds from `artifacts/docs/**`.

## 0.1.2 – 2025-08-17

### Added
* **New Documentation Engine:** Introduced a new modular documentation builder that replaced the previous helper script.
* **CI Artifact Pages:** The documentation site now automatically generates detailed pages for all CI artifacts, including tests, linting, code quality, security, API tests, SBOMs, and citation files.
* **Release Evidence:** The `publish` workflow now downloads all artifacts from the `CI` run, packages them as `evidence/*.tar.gz` bundles, and attaches them to the GitHub Release for traceability.
* **Build Hygiene:** Makefiles now enforce a "hygienic" build process, ensuring all temporary files, caches, and build outputs are stored under the `artifacts/` directory to prevent root directory pollution.

### Changed
* **CI/CD Overhaul:**
    * The CI workflow now uploads each category of artifact separately for better organization and downstream consumption.
    * The docs-build workflow now waits for the main CI run to complete, downloads all artifacts, and uses them to build a data-rich documentation site.
    * The release publish workflow has been streamlined and made more robust, removing the optional "wait for docs" step and improving tag detection.
* **Documentation Content:** The top-level Markdown set, including the README, usage, test, contributor, project-map, and tooling pages, was significantly rewritten and expanded with tables of contents, `back-to-top` links, and cross-references to the new artifact pages.
* **Build System:**
    * All `Makefile` modules have been refactored to use the new hygienic `artifacts/` directory structure for outputs and caches.
    * `tox.ini` has been updated to align with the new Makefile targets and to run a comprehensive suite of checks for the `py311` environment, mirroring the full CI validation process.
* **API Schema:** The OpenAPI `schema.yaml` has been improved with stricter validation (`additionalProperties: false`), better descriptions, response links, and more detailed examples.
* **Source Code:** Refactored async handling in the legacy Python API module and improved type safety across multiple modules with clearer casts.

### Fixed
* **Type Safety:** Resolved numerous previously ignored type errors throughout the codebase and test suite.
* **API Endpoint Logic:** Corrected the item update logic in the legacy HTTP API module by removing a faulty check for duplicate names that was causing incorrect 409 Conflict errors.
* **Test Suite:** Improved the stability and correctness of E2E tests by enhancing golden file comparisons and fixing brittle assertions.

## 0.1.1 – 2025-08-14

### Added
* **Publish pipeline:** GitHub Actions publish workflow that publishes via `make publish` only after required checks are green and a tag is present.
* **Project map:** Project-map pages with a curated overview.
* **Developer Tooling page:** Tooling pages with embedded configs, Makefile snippets, and CI workflows via `include-markdown`.
* **Docs assets:** Community landing page, Plausible analytics partial, and CSS overrides.

### Changed
* **Docs generator:**
  * Copies the top-level README plus the earlier usage, test, project-map, and tooling pages into the site with link rewrites and `{#top}` anchors.
  * Generates mkdocstrings pages for the legacy Python package tree.
  * Builds **one** consolidated **API Reference** with this structure:
    * top: **Api Module**, **Cli Module**, **Httpapi Module**
    * sections (collapsed by default): **Commands**, **Contracts**, **Core**, **Infra**, **Services**
    * nested groups for command subpackages (`config/`, `dev/`, `history/`, `memory/`, `plugins/`) beneath **Commands**.
  * Emits `reference/**/index.md` to power Material’s section indexes.
* **MkDocs config (`mkdocs.yml`):** tightened plugin ordering and settings for `include-markdown`, enabled section indexes, and strict mode; added watch paths for configs and scripts.
* **README / usage pages:** Refined copy; standardized top anchors and companion-page cross-links.
* **SECURITY.md:** Rewritten with clearer reporting, SLAs, scope, and safe harbor.
* **Makefiles:** macOS-safe env handling; Cairo-less Interrogate wrapper for doc coverage.
* **Config:** Expanded lints/dictionary.

### Fixed
* **Docs build (strict):** resolved broken and unknown links in the tooling pages and removed duplicate API Reference sections; left sidebar now stays populated when deep-linking into API pages.
* **Tests:** E2E version fixtures cleaned up.

### Packaging
* **PyPI links corrected:** `project.urls` now points to accurate Homepage/Docs/Changelog/Issues/Discussions.
* **Dynamic versioning from Git tags:** Using `hatch-vcs` with `dynamic = ["version"]`; annotated tags like `v0.1.1` define the release version. `commitizen` tags as `v$version`.
* **Richer PyPI description:** `hatch-fancy-pypi-readme` renders **README.md** + **CHANGELOG.md** on PyPI.
* **Wheel/Sdist layout:** Explicit Hatch build config ensures `py.typed`, licenses, and metadata are included.
