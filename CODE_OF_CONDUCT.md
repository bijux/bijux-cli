# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We pledge to make participation in this community a harassment-free experience for everyone—regardless of age, body size, disability (visible or invisible), ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity or expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation. We commit to interactions that are open, welcoming, inclusive, and healthy.

## Our Standards

**Positive behaviors**

* Show empathy, kindness, and respect.
* Welcome different opinions and experiences.
* Give and receive constructive feedback gracefully.
* Own mistakes, apologize, and learn.
* Prioritize what benefits the community as a whole.

**Unacceptable behaviors**

* Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling; insulting/derogatory remarks; personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment; deliberate intimidation or stalking.
* Publishing others’ private information (e.g., physical or email address) without explicit permission.
* Deliberate misgendering or use of deadnames.
* Any conduct a reasonable person would deem inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code. They may remove or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code and will communicate moderation reasons when appropriate. Actions will be proportional to the circumstances.

## Scope

This Code applies in all project spaces (repositories, issues, discussions, chats) and when individuals are officially representing the project in public spaces (e.g., using an official email, posting via an official account, or representing the project at events—online or offline).

## Reporting

Report abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior to the maintainers at **[mousavi.bijan@gmail.com](mailto:mousavi.bijan@gmail.com)**.

To help us investigate, please include (to the extent you’re comfortable):

* What happened, and when
* Where it occurred (link, channel, or location)
* Names of people involved and any witnesses
* Any relevant context or screenshots

We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and handle reports promptly and fairly. We will respect the privacy and safety of reporters and witnesses.

**Anti-retaliation:** Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern or participates in an investigation is a violation of this Code.

## Enforcement Guidelines

**1) Correction**
*Impact:* Inappropriate or unprofessional behavior.
*Consequence:* Private, written warning that clarifies the violation and sets expectations. A public apology may be requested.

**2) Warning**
*Impact:* A violation through a single incident or a series of actions.
*Consequence:* Formal warning with clear consequences for continued behavior. Limited interaction with affected parties or spaces for a set period.

**3) Temporary Ban**
*Impact:* Serious or sustained violations.
*Consequence:* Temporary ban from interaction or public communication in project spaces for a set period. No public or private interaction with affected parties or enforcers during this time.

**4) Permanent Ban**
*Impact:* Pattern of violations, harassment, or aggression toward individuals or protected classes.
*Consequence:* Permanent ban from all public project spaces.

## Appeals

If you believe an action was taken in error or without sufficient context, you may appeal by replying to the original enforcement notice or emailing **[mousavi.bijan@gmail.com](mailto:mousavi.bijan@gmail.com)** with additional information. Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not directly involved in the original decision when possible.
