"""Provides shared `pytest` fixtures for the Bijux CLI test suite.

This module defines a set of `pytest` fixtures that are automatically
applied to all tests. These fixtures are crucial for ensuring test isolation
and providing a consistent, clean environment for each test case.

The provided fixtures handle:
* Resetting the singleton `DIContainer` between tests to prevent state leakage.
* Cleaning up specific `BIJUXCLI_*` environment variables to avoid
    interference from the host shell.
* Providing a convenient helper for applying multiple monkeypatches.
